This is a very simple game for learning purpose. The following logics are implemented:
1. 3C: This is a 3rd person action game. Players can control the character via mouse and keyboard AWSD and Space. The goal is to collect as many batteries as you can in a limited time interval.
2. During the game, the batteries are dropped at random positions in the scene.
3. When time is out, the character will die and a rigdoll animation will be played.
4. Collision detection: detect collisions among character and the other 3D objects in the scene.
5. Particle system: during the game, the snow flakes are falling onto the floor and accumulated.
